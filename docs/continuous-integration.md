# Flare Portal — Continuous Integration

Github Actions are configured to run CI tests. See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
for more details. CI is run when pushing to `main`, `production`, and when
opening PRs for `main`.

## Code styleguide

This project’s formatting is enforced with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for
supported languages. Make sure to have Prettier integrated with your editor to
auto-format when saving files, or to manually run it before committing (`npm run format`).

This project also uses `black` and `isort`.

## Automatic linting locally

You can also run the linting tests automatically before committing. This is optional. It uses pre-commit, which is installed by default in the vagrant box, and a .pre-commit-config.yml file is included for the project.

To use when making commits on your host machine you must install pre-commit, either create a virtualenv to use with the project or to install globally see instructions at (https://pre-commit.com/#install).

Pre-commit will not run by default. To set it up, run `pre-commit install` inside the Vagrant box, or on the host if you have installed pre-commit there.

The `detect-secrets` pre-commit hook requires a baseline secrets file to be included. If you need to, you can update this file, e.g. when adding dummy secrets for unit tests:

```bash
$ detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline
```
